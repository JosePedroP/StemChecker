This dataset was obtained by identifying genes enriched in the mouse Embryonic Stem Cell (ESC) population when compared to the differentiated cells from Lateral Ventricles of the Brain and from the main cell population of the Bone Marrow (only genes that showed a significant enrichment in both comparisons were selected). In each comparison, a 90% confidence interval was calculated for the fold change in gene expression, and the lower limit of this interval—the lower confidence bound (LCB)—was used as a measure of enrichment in gene expression. Genes with LCB above 1.2 (which corresponds to an estimated fold change of 1.9 in gene expression) were selected as "enriched" in ESCs.

Comparison of the global gene expression profiles associated with the two PKH26 fractions, in each sample, resulted in 4023 probesets differentially expressed in Pool #1, 4659 probesets in Pool #2, and 5278 probesets in Pool #3. To define the ‘‘hNMSC signature,’’it was done an overlap between the three pools of probesets  originating a ‘‘3/3 signature’’ that contains 354 genes (P<10-60) that show the same trend of regulation in all 3 pools, and is therefore a subset of the hNMSC signature.

In order to define the core ESC-like module, we converted the mouse Entrez Gene IDs (EGIDs) of the genes in the mouse ESC-like module to corresponding human EGIDs based on best reciprocal BLAST hit and then looked for the shared EGIDs between the mouse and human ESClike modules.

Signaling pathways regulating pluripotency of stem cells
Data set was generated using REACTO ME database from the "Signaling  pathways regulating pluripotency of stem cells" (map04550) pathway. There are 40 molecules listed in this pathway, key components in clude POU5F1 (OCT4), SOX2 and NANOG . The three transcription factors and their downstream target genes co-ordinately promote self-renewal and pluripotency. Cellular com partments of this pathway are cytosol (GO:0005829 and nucleoplasm (GO:0005654) and the major biological process controlled by this pathway is somatic stem cell maintenance (GO:0035019).

The PluriNetWork is a manually curated protein/gene interaction and regulation network with the purpose of describing pluripotency in mouse. This dataset contais all the genes present in  Plurinetwork.
mESCs;  The network is based upon 177 publications, consists of 274 nodes (genes/proteins) and 574 edges (links) - each representing a direct interaction or regulation between two nodes.

Protein-protein network shared by the pluripotent cells
Genes constituting the pluripotency-associated network (PluriNet) protein-protein network shared by the pluripotent cells (embryonic stem cells, embryonical carcinomas and induced pluripotent cells). Comparing public data shows that PluriNet to be a common characteristic of pluripotent cells, including mouse ES and iPS cells and human oocytes. This data set is obtained by combining gene expression data with physical interactions (protein-protein interactions)in a physical interaction network that show a significant co-expression pattern.
Embryonic stem cells, Germ cell tumor stem cells, iPSC, stems cells from brain, bone marrow, umbilical cord, connective tissue, un differentiated cells, cells from different lineages such as neural, astrocytic, fibroblasts, mesenchymal, endodermal, embroid and endothelial.
