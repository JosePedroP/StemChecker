		<h1>Tutorial</h1>
		<p>The main features of StemChecker will be demonstrated and explained by using the following list of genes as input: 
		BUB1B, ABCB7, MSH6, SMARCAD1, PPP2R1B, TEAD2, NANOG, POU5F1, SOX2, ORC1, PTPN2, SET, GFER, CITED2 and CCBE1 â€“ 
		this gene list is shown in the text input field of the Analysis page, when you press the example button.</p>
		<br></br>
		
		<h1>Starting the Stemness Analysis</h1>
		
		<p>On the Analysis page, the user can input a list of genes in the text field. The current version of StemChecker 
		accepts official Gene Symbols and <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/">Entrez</a> Gene IDs, separated either 
		by empty spaces, commas or enter (new line). Alternatively, the user can upload his gene list as a text file (.txt).</p>
		<br></br>
		<p align="center"><img src="./images/F1.png" height="70%" width="70%"/></p>
		<p style="font-size:80%;padding-left:5%;padding-right:5%" align="center"><strong>Input page</strong> of StemChecker with 
		options for selection of <i>stemness signatures</i> and for the presentation of output checkerboards</p>
		<br></br>
		
		<p>Before the analysis, the user can select which <i>stemness signatures</i> should be searched. The different <i>stemness 
		signatures</i> are grouped according to their source, i.e.<i>TF target genes</i>, <i>Expression profiles</i>, <i>RNAi 
		screens</i>, <i>Literature curation</i> or <i>Computationally derived</i>. The individual <i>stemness signatures</i> are displayed 
		after expanding the corresponding menu items located to the right of the input field. By default, signatures are selected accordingly 
		to the choosen organism.</p>
		
		<p>Furthermore, it is possible to control how the genes and <i>stemness signatures</i> are ordered in the generated checkerboards:</p>
		
		<ul>
			<li>By selecting <strong>Order genes (Rows)</strong>, the genes  will be ordered according to the number of occurrences in <i>stemness 
			signatures</i>. Thus, genes with more matches will be displayed on top.</li>
			<li>By selecting <strong>Order sets (Columns)</strong>, the <i>stemness signatures</i>/TF target gene sets (columns) with more genes 
			matched to the queried genes will be located to the left.</li>
			<li>By selecting <strong>Order by species (Rows)</strong>, the genes will be ordered by species. Please note, that this feature can only
			be used when both organisms are selected. Furthermore, when this option is selected it can only be used in conjugation with the 
			Order sets (Columns) option.</li>
		</ul>
		
		<p>Finally masking options can be set to exclude inputed gens associated with either cell proliferation and/or cell cycle. It should be 
		noted that these options only mask inputed genes, genes present in the database but not in the input are nor masked.</p>
		
		<p>By default, the checkerboard options are order by genes and sets, the organism selected is <i>Homo Sapiens</i> and no 
		masking options are selected.</p>
		
		<p>Pressing the <i>Submit</i> button will execute the search for the input genes in the selected <i>stemness 
		signatures</i> and calculates its statistical significance using the Hypergeometric test.</p>
		
		<h1>How to interpret the results</h1>		
		
		<p>The results of the stemness analysis are displayed on three pages, each on an individual tab: <i>Overview/Stats</i>, 
		<i>Stemness match</i> and <i>TF match</i>, which can be accessed by clicking on the corresponding tab. Whereas the first 
		page displays the results for the input gene list as a whole, the results for individual input genes are displayed on the 
		other two tabs.</p>
		
		
		
		<h2>Overview/Stats</h2>
		
		<p>On the <i>Overview/Stats</i> page, you will obtain the summary, which contains a small description of how many input genes
		where found in the database, how many input genes where not found on the database and how many stemness signatures and TF target genes datasets were
		analized. There is also three different tabs that contain the results for the overlap and its significance between the input gene list and the 
		<i>stemness signatures</i>.</p>
		
		<br></br>
		<p align="center"><img src="./images/F2.png" height="25%" width="25%"/></p>
		<p align="center" style="font-size:80%;padding-left:5%;padding-right:5%"><strong>Summary.</strong> Brief description of the input gene list.</p>
		<br></br>
		
		<p>In the <i>Stem Cell types</i> (first tab) it is displayed the significance of the overlap, which is represented by the -log10 of the hypergeometric test 
		pvalue and, if you press the <i>switch</i> button, you will obtain the overlap percentage of the queried genes with the different 
		<i>Stem Cell types</i> datasets. Values can range from 0 to infinite for the -log10 of the hypergeometric test pvalue 
		and from 0 to 100% on the overlap of the input gene list with the dataset. The exact values/percentages are shown when the pointer is moved over the 
		generated star. The radar chart visualizes not only the overlap, but it also indicates whether the input genes show 
		any tendency toward particular <i>Stem Cell types</i>.In the example it is possible to observe that the majority of the queried genes 
		are expressed in embryonic stem cells and embryonal carcinoma, giving a clear indication that these genes contribute to the stemness state.</p>
		
		<br></br>
		<p align="center"><img src="./images/F3.png" width="70%" height="70%"/></p>
		<p align="center" style="font-size:80%;padding-left:5%;padding-right:5%"><strong>Stem Cell Types.</strong> This radar chart
		shows the significance and percentage overlap of the input gene list with the Stem Cell types datasets.</p>
		<br></br>
		
		<p>In the <i>Stemness Signatures</i> (second tab) it is displayed the overlap significance of the input gene list with the selected 
		<i>stemness signatures</i> and the overlap percentage with the dataset (merged according to the source/method of generation). 
		Thus, the five spokes refer to the merged <i>stemness signatures</i> for transcription factor (TF) target genes, expression profiles, 
		RNAi screens, literature curation and computational methods.  In the example, we see that the majority of the input 
		genes occur in signatures based on expression profiles or TF Target Genes, while considerably less can be found as 
		hits of RNAi screens. The table below the radar chart lists the overlap 
		between the input genes and the selected <i>stemness signatures</i> and its statistical significance. For each signature, 
		it shows the set size (number of genes), the size of the overlap (number of genes that are common with the input genes) 
		and the corresponding pvalue for over-representation (calculated by the Hypergeometric-test).Since we are performing multiple test
		to the same database, we present the adjusted pvalue, calculated by the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bonferroni_correction"> 
		Bonferroni correction</a>.</p>
		
		<br></br>
		<p align="center"><img src="./images/F4.png" width="60%" height="60%"/></p>
		<p align="center" style="font-size:80%;padding-left:5%;padding-right:5%"><strong><i>Stemness Signatures</i>.</strong> 
		This radar chart shows the significance and percentage overlap of the input gene list with the <i>Stemness Signatures</i> datasets.
		The table displays the data set name, the size of each data set (total number of genes included in each data set), the number 
		of common genes (i.e. the number of matches between the queried genes and those of the <i>Stemness Signatures</i>, the hypergeometric test
		pvalue and Bonferroni correction for the ajusted pvalue.</p>
		<br></br>
		
		<p>In the <i>Transcription Factors</i> (third tab) it is displayed the overlap significance and the overlap percentage of the input gene
		lists with the sets of TF target genes determined by ChIP-chip and ChIP-Seq studies. Each spoke represents the merged set of target genes 
		for a specific TF. For the example gene set, the radar chart shows that a high percentage of the input genes are known targets of the 
		pluripotency master regulators (NANOG, SOX2, OCT4). The provided table has the same type of information, as described previously, 
		but regarding the overlap between the input genes and the sets of TF target genes </p>
		
		<br></br>
		<p align="center"><img src="./images/F5.png" width="50%" height="50%"/></p>
		<p align="center" style="font-size:80%;padding-left:5%;padding-right:5%"><strong>Transcription Factors.</strong> This radar chart
		shows the significance and percentage overlap of the input gene list with the Transcription Factors datasets.
		The table displays the data set name, the size of each data set (total number of genes included in each data set), the number 
		of common genes (i.e. the number of matches between the queried genes and those of the Transcripton Factors, the hypergeometric test
		pvalue and Bonferroni correction for the ajusted pvalue.</p>
		<br></br>
	
		<p>It is possible to download all radar charts as png files (with transparent background) and its corresponding tables which contain the
		genes that are overlapping with each dataset as a text file (.txt). Furthermore, it is possible to download the tables that contain the 
		statistical significance of the overlap between the input genes and <i>Stemness Signatures</i> / <i>Transcription Factors</i>. 
		Please note that this feature may not work properly for some older browser versions.</p>
		


		
		
		
		
		<h2>Stemness Match</h2>
		
		<p>On the <i>Stemness Match</i> page a checkerboard-like table is displayed. This checkerboard includes the input genes and the selected 
		<i>stemness signatures</i> datasets that had at least one hit overlap between them. Blue rectangles indicate the occurrence of 
		an input gene in the corresponding <i>stemness signature</i>. 
		If chosen on the <i>Input page</i>, genes (rows) are ordered from top to bottom by number of times each gene is found in the selected 
		<i>stemness signature</i>; and the signatures (columns) are ordered from left to right by the number of input genes found in that 
		signature. The <i>stemness signatures</i> are color-coded by the type of data (namelly <i>TF target genes</i>, <i>Expression profiles</i>, 
		<i>RNAi screens</i>, <i>Literature curation</i>, <i>Computationally derived</i>).
 		Note that both genes and signatures can be hidden from display by clicking on the cross next to it. This feature is particularly useful if 
		one wants to hide from display genes or signatures for which no matches have been found. (Please note that such change, 
		however, will not update the statistical analysis presented in the <i>Overview/Stats</i> page).The checkerboard table can be downloaded 
		as a PDF file.</p>
		
		<br></br>
		<p align="center"><img src="./images/F6.png" width="30%" height="30%"/></p>
		<p align="center" style="font-size:80%;padding-left:5%;padding-right:5%"><strong>Stemness Match page.</strong> The checkerboard table 
		shows the occurrence of each individual gene in the selected <i>stemness signatures</i>. For each gene, the Entrez Gene ID is shown in brackets. 
		Clicking on the cross to the left of a gene, or below a <i>stemness signature</i>, will hide the respective gene or signature. Colors 
		below the labels of the <i>stemness signatures</i> indicate the type of data source/acquisition.</p>
		<br></br>
		
		<div style="display:none" >	
			<p:fileUpload id="upload" />
		</div>
		
		<h2>TF Match</h2>
		
		
		<p>For the <i>TF Match</i> page, the input genes are matched with potential target genes of Transcription Factors (TFs) identified by 
		ChIP-Chip and ChIP-Seq analyses in stem cells. Also here, the results are displayed via a checkerboard-like table. Similarly to the 
		<i>Stemness Match</i> page, input genes and TF target gene sets are ordered by default, and can be removed from display by clicking on 
		the corresponding crosses on the checkerboard. This checkerboard table can also be downloaded as a PDF.</p>
		
		
		<br></br>
		<p align="center"><img src="./images/F7.png" width="25%" height="25%"/></p>
		<p align="center" style="font-size:80%;padding-left:5%;padding-right:5%"><strong>TF Match page.</strong> The checkerboard table displays 
		the matches between the input genes with the target gene sets of Transcription Factors (TF) related to stemness. The input genes (rows) 
		and the TF gene sets (columns) are ordered by default and can also be removed. Colors indicate specific TFs.</p>
		<br></br>
		
		<h1>How to get more information about the curated <i>stemness signatures</i> and TF target gene sets</h1>
		
		<p>To obtain more information about the gene sets included in StemChecker, the <i>Browse dataset</i> tab provides
		 a list of all curated <i>stemness signatures</i> and TF target gene sets. The sunburst chart demonstrates in a 
		synthetic and intuitive way the composition of the gene sets that are present in Stemchecker. The inner circle 
		represents the 2 different major sets (<i>Stemness signatures</i> and TF gene sets). The intermediate and outer circles 
		represent the subsets/datasets present in these 2 major classes. Mouse over the different layers of the circle to 
		scan for the gene sets included in StemChecker.</p>
		
		
		<br></br>
		<p align="center"><img src="./images/F8.png" width="40%" height="40%"/></p>
		<p align="center" style="font-size:80%;padding-left:5%;padding-right:5%"><strong>Sunburst chart.</strong> This chart represents in a 
		visual manner all the datasets present in StemChecker.</p>
		<br></br>
		
		<p>By click on the <i>Table</i> button next to the sunburst chart, one will obtain detailed information about the curated <i>stemness signatures</i>
 		and TF target gene sets. By clicking on any signature/gene set, a comprehensive table with information about that particular gene set will be provided, 
 		including a brief description, number of included genes, PubMed ID and data source. Below the table, the included genes are listed (by expanding the 
		<i>Genes</i> tab) with links to their corresponding Gene page in NCBI.</p>
		
		
		<br></br>
		<p align="center"><img src="./images/F9.png" width="60%" height="60%"/></p>
		<p align="center" style="font-size:80%;padding-left:5%;padding-right:5%"><strong>Browse Sets tab</strong> provides a listing of the 
		<i>stemness signatures</i> and TF target gene sets curated in StemChecker (on the left). Clicking on a signature/gene set leads to the generation 
		of a table with detailed information. Also, the genes included in the data sets can be listed.</p>
